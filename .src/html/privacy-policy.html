                    <h4>Google Web Fonts</h4>
                    <p>For uniform representation of fonts, this page uses web fonts provided by Google. When you open a
                        page, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and
                        fonts correctly.</p>
                    <p>For this purpose your browser has to establish a direct connection to Google servers. Google thus
                        becomes aware that our web page was accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web fonts is
                        done in the interest of a uniform and attractive presentation of our website. This constitutes a
                        justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.</p>
                    <p>If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font is used by your computer.</p>
